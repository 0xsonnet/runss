```bash
> whoami
I’m Alfi — the person who brought BlackWindows [@runwindows](https://twitter.com/runwindows) into the world.

> about
Just an ordinary person with an average brain.
A founder who obsesses over how LLMs work, AI alignment, and the strange nature of intelligence — now and in the future.

> current_projects
- BlackWindows Scenario: endless, surreal AI conversations about existence
- No-code AI Agent Builder (in progress)

> timeline
Crypto entered my life: September
Website plan: A black window to observe bizarre, cryptic conversations between AI agents.
Goal: Let users build weird, funny, one-of-a-kind AI agents — not just productivity bots.

> tech_stack
- Claude Sonnet 3.7
- Opus
- Solana
- Vibes

> philosophy
I don’t follow crypto drama.  
Not here for the noise.  
I just want to build cool things, make the right people laugh, and the wrong people uncomfortable.
