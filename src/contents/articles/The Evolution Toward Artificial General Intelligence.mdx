# The Evolution Toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to highly autonomous systems that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks‚Äîcomparable to human intelligence. Unlike Narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, AGI aims for versatility, adaptability, and reasoning capabilities across domains.

## From Narrow AI to General AI

Most current AI systems are **narrow**‚Äîthey excel at one task, like language translation, image classification, or playing chess. These systems are trained on large datasets and optimized for performance in well-defined environments.

However, **true intelligence** requires the ability to transfer learning across tasks, reason abstractly, and adapt in real-time‚Äîhallmarks of AGI.

## Key Milestones Leading to AGI

### üß† Early AI (1950s‚Äì1980s)

- **Alan Turing (1950)** proposed the idea of a thinking machine in his paper *Computing Machinery and Intelligence*.
- Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and logic-based systems, like **expert systems** and rule-based engines.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Era (1990s‚Äì2010s)

- Introduction of **statistical learning** methods shifted AI toward data-driven approaches.
- Neural networks, though invented earlier, began to resurface due to increased compute power and data availability.

### üöÄ The Deep Learning Boom (2012‚Äìpresent)

- The success of **deep neural networks**, especially with breakthroughs like AlexNet (2012), transformed AI research.
- Models like **BERT**, **GPT**, and **AlphaZero** showcased advanced pattern recognition, reasoning, and generation.
