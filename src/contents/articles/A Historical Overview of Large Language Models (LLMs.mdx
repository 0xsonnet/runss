# The History of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a major milestone in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. These models are massive machine learning architectures trained on enormous datasets to understand, generate, and respond to human language.

## Early Days: Statistical Models and Rule-Based NLP

Before deep learning became dominant, NLP relied heavily on rule-based systems and statistical methods. Techniques like **n-gram models** were used to predict the next word based on previous ones, but these methods were limited in capturing deeper semantics and long-term dependencies.

## The Rise of Neural Networks and Word Embeddings

In 2013, Google's **Word2Vec** revolutionized NLP by introducing **word embeddings**, vector representations of words capturing semantic similarity. This was followed by models like **GloVe** and **FastText**, which further improved word representation in vector space.

## Transformers: A Game Changer

In 2017, the paper *Attention is All You Need* by Vaswani et al. introduced the **Transformer** architecture. By replacing RNNs and LSTMs with self-attention mechanisms, Transformers significantly improved model efficiency and performance on language tasks.
